I first started by creating a Github joruanl Entery, for me to track down all problems i encountered and resolved.
My first probelm i got hit with was being unable to make headings and subheadings in git hub, my tutored showed me what was wrong and all i had to do was change the jorunal to .md which has now made me edit the titles and sub titles.

Internet cut out for 15 mins during lesson, wasnt too bad as i was following tutorial on macbook and writing up but disconected for call on discord.
