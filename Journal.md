I first started by creating a Github joruanl Entery, for me to track down all problems i encountered and resolved.
My first probelm i got hit with was being unable to make headings and subheadings in git hub, my tutored showed me what was wrong and all i had to do was change the jorunal to .md which has now made me edit the titles and sub titles.

Internet cut out for 15 mins during lesson, wasnt too bad as i was following tutorial on macbook and writing up but disconected for call on discord.

When finishing up my tutorial i had to go back into my unity file to retrace my steps however, unity wasnt opening up as it seemed that the verison was lost, so it took me 10 to 15 mins or so to re download the verison and place it in the right file.

For the lesson today we were given our next assignment which was to design a tutorial again, demonstrating a combined component behaviours. This means all the coding we do will link together to make a game come together such as a piece of code to walk, which will have another code that made enable it to jump and so on. These codes should be able to be used and re-used in multiple games. I couldnt seem to find somthing i wanted to make and show as for my 4 other tutorials i made a first person shooter. So ive decided to go with an enemy walk cycle who will switch paths.
