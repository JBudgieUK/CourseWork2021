I first started by creating a Github joruanl Entery, for me to track down all problems i encountered and resolved.
My first probelm i got hit with was being unable to make headings and subheadings in git hub, my tutored showed me what was wrong and all i had to do was change the jorunal to .md which has now made me edit the titles and sub titles.

Internet cut out for 15 mins during lesson, wasnt too bad as i was following tutorial on macbook and writing up but disconected for call on discord.

When finishing up my tutorial i had to go back into my unity file to retrace my steps however, unity wasnt opening up as it seemed that the verison was lost, so it took me 10 to 15 mins or so to re download the verison and place it in the right file.

I will be starting my third tutorial which follows on from the second First person camera tutorial in which i will making a gun fire from the camera like a First person shooter.

Today i will start my last tutorial, in which i again will be following up from my third tutorial to round off my first person shooter. Today i will be coding to aim in the site and out of the site when right clickin with the gun.
I had trouble during this tutorial with the 2 perspecties of the gun. When i right clicked to aim down site the gun would be in a different location to the camera. so this took alot of time out of building the project. But i did seem to figure it out and aline it back up with the camera.

For the lesson today we were given our next assignment which was to design a tutorial again, demonstrating a combined component behaviours. This means all the coding we do will link together to make a game come together such as a piece of code to walk, which will have another code that made enable it to jump and so on. These codes should be able to be used and re-used in multiple games. I designed a menu, with a settings page, Credits, quit and play. The play will load up a new scene with a basic level
