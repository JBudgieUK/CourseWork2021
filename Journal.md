I first started by creating a Github joruanl Entery, for me to track down all problems i encountered and resolved.
My first probelm i got hit with was being unable to make headings and subheadings in git hub, my tutored showed me what was wrong and all i had to do was change the jorunal to .md which has now made me edit the titles and sub titles.
